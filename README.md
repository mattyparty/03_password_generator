# Week 3 Boot 03_password_generator Homework

Well this week was a tough one. First week learning Java script. 

I did complete the work it it functions! I did not tweak the design of the generator, i just focused on the Java Script

* I created a function called generatepassword(). This ties to the provided html and css

* I utilized for loops, prompts, variables and arrays.

* Personally i feel my code is very long.  I think there is a better way utizling loops more effiecently also i believe there are some built in JavaScript procedures (thats not the right word) for the numbers and charecters instead of putting them in an array.

* I used random() for selecting which charecter in the arrays. Also i used random to determine which of the charecter arrays to choose

I am definately learning alot and sadly learning how much i dont know.  I look forward to reading my grading notes its so far they have been very helpfull. 

Thank You!!!
